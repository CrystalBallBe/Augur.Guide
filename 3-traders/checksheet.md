# Traders: Check Sheet

Here is a quick reference of things to look for when deciding whether or not to trade on a market, to avoid getting tricked or scammed:

- Is the market question objective and unambiguous?
- Could the market be interpreted in more than one way?
- Does the price action, trade history, or order book(s) seem unusual?
- Am I ok with the fees?
- Will the market question only have one answer in the end?
- Will the answer to the market question be known before the market end date/time?
- Does any of the information provided in the market conflict with other parts of the market?
- Have I considered all possible edge cases with the market?
- Does the time of day matter? If so, does the market specify a timezone?
- Will reporters in the future be able to verify the answer using the resolution source provided?

You can also ask the Augur community about a particular market if you are unsure. People will gladly flag potentially Invalid markets in the [Augur Discord](https://discord.gg/faud6Fx) and [https://reddit.com/r/Augur](Reddit).
