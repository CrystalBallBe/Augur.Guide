# Reporters 

Reporters are people who own Augur’s token, REP. REP holders have the power to affect the final outcome of Augur’s markets. Their job is to oversee the initial report of a market and ensure it is the correct answer. For doing this work REP holders are rewarded with ETH, collected as reporting fees.

##Why would a reporter want to report the truth? 

Why not lie and try to scam others? Well,  reporters have a symbiotic relationship with market traders. Traders pay reporters a percentage in fees when SHARES are redeemed or burned for ETH, which is called the reporting fee. They pay this fee to reporters so that they can have confidence that the market they are trading on will resolve correctly, so that it matches what actually happened in the real world. If traders do not have this confidence, they will not use Augur. If traders aren’t using Augur, REP is worthless.

##What happens if different reporters disagree as to what the truth is? 

Well, there are a series of dispute rounds where reporters can stake a bond to make one of the outcomes the “tentative outcome”. Then time is given to other reporters to stake a higher bond on one of the other outcomes. This continues until the next bond doesn’t fill after a week, or a fork threshold is reached. This is detailed on the [Reporting Process](https://augur.guide/4-reporters/1-reporting-process.html) page.

##Why would reporters risk their REP to correct a market for traders? 

Well, once a disputed market’s outcome is resolved, the reporters who staked on the winning outcome get to take the REP that was staked on the incorrect outcome(s). Due to the way the dispute round bond sizes scale, this results in a 50% ROI (payable in REP) for the reporters. So on any individual market, you can potentially earn 50% by disputing against liars by reporting the truth. And for Augur as a whole, reporters want to report the truth so that traders use the system, generate fees, and thus give a fundamental value to ETH.
