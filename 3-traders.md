# Traders 

Traders are the lifeblood of Augur. Your actions as a trader keep the system running and provide useful information about the likelihood of particular future events. You put your money where your mouth is by exchanging ETH for SHARES (an [ERC 20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC-20) token) of a particular market outcome, at a specific price. As a trader trying to profit, you believe that those SHARES are likely going to be worth more in the future, based on your own internal estimate of the balance of probabilities. The combination of many traders all exchanging their information on the likelihood of an event's outcome gives everyone useful information to help make better decisions.

The default Augur reference UI currently provides price information about a market from a financial traders perspective, but the same information can also be presented in the various forms of gambling odds standards. We will stick to the financial traders perspective here.
