Dispute               : Dispute is used to describe the act of a REP holder Staking REP on a Market Outcome other than the Tentative Outcome for that Market. This REP is sent to a Crowdsourcer and goes toward filling a Dispute Bond for that Outcome in order to Dispute or “challenge” the Tentative Outcome of a Market before it is Finalized. If the Dispute Bond is successfully filled, and that Outcome becomes the Final Outcome for the Market, the users who Staked REP on that Outcome can get back 1.5x the amount of REP they originally Staked, once the Market is Finalized. If the Dispute Bond is successfully filled, but that Outcome does not become the Final Outcome for the Market, the users who Staked REP on that Outcome will forfeit all of the REP they Staked. If the Dispute Bond is not successfully filled, the users who Staked on that Outcome can redeem their REP once the Fee Window has elapsed.
Ask Order             : An Ask Order is an Order indicating the desire of the Order Creator to sell Shares of one or more Outcomes. This is the opposite of a Bid Order.
Atto- (Prefix)        : Atto- is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of 10^−18, or 0.000000000000000001. This prefix is used for a number of terms in Augur, including attoETH, attoREP, attotoken, etc.
Bid Order             : A Bid Order is an Order indicating the desire of the Order Creator to buy Shares of one or more Outcomes. This is the opposite of an Ask Order.
Cash                  : Cash is an ERC-20 token that is used within Augur’s Solidity smart contracts and acts as a wrapper for ETH to facilitate some of Augur’s functionality. Users do not interact directly with Cash tokens in Augur.
Categorical Market    : A Categorical Market is a Market with more than 2 potential Outcomes, but no more than 8. As with all Markets, Invalid is also a potential Outcome, but it does not count toward the 8-Outcome maximum. Categorical Markets are best for multiple choice questions, such as “Which team will win Tournament X?” or “What color tie will the U.S. President wear at the next presidential press conference?”. If a Market is based around a simple yes-or-no question, it is better to use a Yes/No Market. For a Market about what a particular stock price will be on a given date, a Scalar Market should be used, as 8 potential outcomes would not be sufficient.
Child Universe        : A Child Universe is a Universe created after a Market Forks. Child Universes have a Parent Universe, which is the Universe where the Forked Market resides. Locked Universes always have Child Universes because the Forking process causes the Universe containing the Forked Market to become Locked and creates the Child Universes.
Complete Set          : A Complete Set is a collection of Shares in every Outcome. Complete Sets are created when the Creator and Filler of an Order both use currency to pay for the trade, as opposed to one or both parties using Shares to complete the Trade. When both parties use shares to complete a trade, then a Complete Set will be formed and Settled (destroyed). The cost in attoETH of a Complete Set for a particular Market is determined by the Number of Ticks for that Market. When Complete Sets are Settled, Settlement Fees are extracted from the value of the Complete Set and are paid proportionally by both parties. Therefore, users who get a larger payout from Settlement also pay a larger portion of the fees. The Settlement Fees extracted from Share Settlement go toward paying for the Reporting system, in the form of a Reporting Fee, and paying the Market Creator their set Creator Fee.
Creator Fee           : A Creator Fee is a percentage fee, in ETH, that is collected by the Market Creator whenever Shares are Settled. It is set by the Market Creator when he or she creates a new Market. The Creator Fee must be between 0% and 50%, and it cannot be changed once it has been set. The Creator Fee and the Reporting Fee are both extracted at the same time whenever Shares are Settled. Shares can be Settled when a user sells a Complete Set or when the Market has been Finalized and a user wants to close an open Position. The Creator Fee is designed to incentivize users to make popular Markets as they stand to earn money if enough people trade on the Market. They can then recoup their Market creation cost and ideally turn a profit on posting interesting Markets. The Settlement Fees are discussed in more details in the Trading section of the documentation.
Decentralized Oracle  : The heart of Augur is its Decentralized Oracle, which allows users and smart contracts to propose questions to Augur and discover accurate information about the real world (based on how REP holders have voted on Market Outcomes) without having to trust a single person, AI, or organization. Augur’s Oracle allows information to be migrated from the real world to a blockchain without relying on a centralized, trusted third party.
Designated Report     : A Designated Report occurs when a Designated Reporter Stakes REP on a particular Outcome in a Market. This Outcome then becomes the Tentative Outcome for the Market, and the Market changes to the Waiting for the Next Fee Window to Begin Phase.
