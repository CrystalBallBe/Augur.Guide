# Market Creators Check Sheet

Here’s a quick list of questions you should ask yourself before you hit that final submit button to send the transaction to create your market:

- [ ] Is my market question objective and unambiguous?
- [ ] Will my market question only have one answer?
- [ ] Will the answer to my market question be known before the market end date/time?
- [ ] Does any of the information provided in my market conflict with other parts of the market?
- [ ] Have I considered all possible edge cases with my market?
- [ ] Does the time of day matter? If so, have I specified a timezone for my market?
- [ ] Will reporters in the future be able to verify the answer using the resolution source provided?
- [ ] Will people from all over the world be reasonably able to understand the market question?
- [ ] Could I add more information to the “Additional Details” section to help traders and reporters understand the intent of my market?
- [ ] Do I have enough ETH and REP available to post the required bonds?
- [ ] Will I be adding liquidity to this market, and what is my market making strategy?
- [ ] Will I be available to be the designated reporter during the 3-day initial report window after the market end date? S
