### Calculators/Other Services

<https://augur.casino/> - A hosted implementation of the Augur reference UI. Requires trusting that the host is providing legitimate information, as compared to running the Augur UI yourself.

<https://reporters.chat/> - A fantastic tool for reporters. It allows you to comment on specific markets and discuss how it should resolve. You can also see the dispute history of a market and also provide information why you staked on a certain outcome. A few charts are also provided.

<http://dispute.tools/#/> - A dispute crowdsourcer. Allows for reporters to pool together funds for a dispute before it is active in a fee window. This can be helpful for markets where there is competition to fill a dispute bond. Helps prevent gas wars, and allows for regular reporters who don't know how to program their own dispute bots to get a chance to dispute as well. Note that the author has since disappeared since creating this tool, so it is no longer being updated and the code has never been audited. Documentation can be found here: <https://github.com/burdakovd/augur-dispute-crowdsourcer>
