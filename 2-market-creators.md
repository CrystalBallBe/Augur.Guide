# Market Creators

Anyone can be a market creator, so that means anyone can create a market. This is a necessity for Augur to be censorship resistant, but that also means that not all markets are going to be high quality. There are many factors that go into creating a "good" market, and it actually isn't terribly easy. That's where Augur.Guide comes in.

A market should ask a question about a future event that is publicly verifiable in some way, usually through the Internet.
