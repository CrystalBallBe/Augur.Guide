# Market Creators

Anyone can be a market creator. This is a necessity for Augur to be censorship resistant, but that also means that not all markets are going to be high quality. There are many factors that go into creating a “good” market, and it can be a bit tricky.

A market should ask a question about a future event that is publicly verifiable in some way. Common topics include the outcome of sports games, political events, financial trading, derivatives, insurance, bug bounties, the weather, and more.

Once a market question has been thought of, there are a few parameters you must be aware of that are required to create a market on Augur:

1. _Market Question_ - The question that you want the world to predict, and it is also the title of the market. It should be about something in the future since traders won’t bother with events that have already happened. Put a good amount of thought into this, since Augur has limitations and can’t answer everything. You should be picking a question where you are certain (beyond a reasonable doubt) that the answer will be publicly verifiable by the market end time (also called market expiration). The question can’t be subjective or ambiguous, there needs to be one final truth that Augur reporters can agree on when the time comes. You don’t need to put every little detail into the title, as there is more room for lots of text in the “Additional Details” section of the market. The title can short and catchy to attract attention, but it also can’t conflict with what the rest of your market parameters are. Market questions typically have some sort of time requirement, like “Will X happen by Y date?” - Be careful with date/time formatting and put in a timezone since Augur is a global platform, otherwise [UTC time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) will generally be assumed. Putting the timezone in the additional details section is also acceptable.

2. _Category/Tags_ - Used by the Augur UI to help sort your market and make it more findable by other users. 

3. _Market Type_ - Augur currently supports three different kinds of markets which determine the potential answers to your Market Question: 
Yes/No - The simplest option, and the best to start with if you are new. The only answers to your market question are “Yes” and “No” (or Invalid, but that is not a tradeable outcome in version 1 of the Augur smart contracts). Selecting this option means you need to phrase your Market Question such that the answer is yes or no. Presently, the Augur UI only shows the order book for the “Yes” option, which helps consolidate liquidity and keeps things simpler in the UI which is another benefit to beginners.
Multiple Choice / Categorical - You get to pick from 2 to 8 possible answers, and there will be a separate order book for each. If you create this type of market, be careful to consider full coverage of all the different possibilities the answer to your market question could end up being. A simple trick is to include one of your options as “Other”.
Numerical Range / Scalar - These are more complex and will not be covered by this guide, for now. Avoid these until you are much more comfortable with Augur and have used it extensively.

4. _Additional Details_ - This is a large text field for you to put in as much detailed information about the market as you would like. Use this field to provide all of the pertinent and meticulous specifics about what you are asking about. Sometimes getting across all the details can be very difficult, so you can also use this to clarify the intent of the question just to guard against edge case interpretations that you hadn’t considered at the time you wrote the market question. You could also use this field to provide additional resolution source details or how to find the answer to the question.

5. _Resolution Source_ - This can either be “General knowledge”, or “Outcome will be detailed on a public website”, in which you then provide the public website address. You should probably default to using general knowledge for most questions, unless it is likely that multiple answers will be possible and you want to use a specific web site as the singular answer. This is common for cryptocurrency financial markets, where different exchanges have slightly different answers for what the price of a cryptocurrency is at a specific time. Note that the answer to the market question needs to be able to be historically referenced by reporters, potentially months after the market end time (due to the dispute and forking process). Some resolution sources might give you the answer to your question, but only for a short time period. This can present issues for reporters looking up the market answer later on, and can result in the market resolving as invalid. Sometimes an archive tool like [The Internet Archive](web.archive.org) can be used to find the historical answer, but it is not 100% reliable. It is possible that an archiving tool specifically for Augur may be created in the future to improve the reliability of using specific web sites as resolution sources. But for now, try to stick to general knowledge markets if you are new to Augur.

6. _Designated Reporter_ - This is the Ethereum address that is allowed to do the initial report for the market to determine its initial tentative outcome. Note that this address cannot unilaterally decide what the answer to the market is, as any REP holder can dispute the answer. The designated reporter can be the same address used to create the market, and it most commonly is. There is a “no-show” bond that must be put up by the market creator which is lost if the designated reporter doesn’t show up on time (within 3 days of the market end time) to put forth the initial tentative outcome.

7. _Market End Time_ - This is the time where the market enters the reporting phase to determine what the correct answer is. The answer to the market must be known **before** the market end time. If the answer to the market is not known by this time, the market will be invalid. It is recommended to set the market end time well after the event is expected to occur, to give plenty of wiggle room for unexpected delays. Potential delays can vary dramatically between domains: sports games usually resolve within a day but political election results can be delayed for weeks. 
- Note that timezones also matter. If a timezone was not specified in the market question/additional details, UTC will generally be used. The Augur UI will convert timestamp fields to **your** local time for display, but are actually stored in UTC on the blockchain. If you don’t want to think too hard about this, just set the market end time at least one day after the answer to your market question should be known.
